## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Technical Implementation

### 1. Hardware Integration
Created a robust communication pipeline between components:
- **RPi 4B** (Mission Control):
- GPIO 14/15 UART @57600 baud
- **Pixhawk** (Flight Controller):

üí° **Key Insight:** Direct GPIO UART outperforms any other sort of communication, ensuring lower latency and more reliable control.

### 2. Software Stack
Developed a custom autonomy pipeline using DroneKit Python:
```python
# DroneKit Waypoint Script
from dronekit import connect, Command
from pymavlink import mavutil

# Connect to the vehicle
vehicle = connect('/dev/ttyAMA0', wait_ready=True)

# Define a waypoint command
cmd = Command(0, 0, 0, mavutil.mavlink.MAV_FRAME_GLOBAL_RELATIVE_ALT,
              mavutil.mavlink.MAV_CMD_NAV_WAYPOINT, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
              lat, lon, alt)

# Add command to mission
cmds = vehicle.commands
cmds.add(cmd)
cmds.upload()
```
This script demonstrates how waypoints are added and uploaded to the Pixhawk for guided missions.

Key Insight: Leveraging DroneKit and MAVProxy enables robust mission control while maintaining full programmability for future enhancements
### 3. 3D-Printed Mount
To integrate the Raspberry Pi into the drone‚Äôs frame, a custom **3D-printed mount** was designed:
- **Material**: PLA for its lightweight properties and durability.
- **Design**: A snug fit to ensure stability and minimize vibrations that could affect communication.
- **Iteration Process**: Two prototypes were created, adjusting for secure attachment and optimal placement of the Raspberry Pi.

**Key Insight:** The use of a well-designed mount reduced noise from vibrations, improved connection reliability, and ensured the Raspberry Pi remained securely in place during test flights.

### 4. Demo Run and Load Testing
The drone was put through a rigorous set of tests to evaluate its real-world performance:
- **Waypoint Mission Test**: A pre-defined mission was uploaded to the Pixhawk, and the drone executed it flawlessly, with waypoint accuracy recorded at ¬±2 meters.
- **Load Testing**: The drone was progressively loaded with weights to determine its payload capacity while maintaining stability.

**Results:**
- Maximum payload: **500g** without affecting stability.
- Mission execution: Smooth and within expected precision thresholds, even under load.

**Key Insight:** Load testing validated the drone‚Äôs structural and operational integrity, proving its readiness for further enhancements.

## Future Plans
This project marks the beginning of an exciting journey into autonomous drones. The next phases will focus on extending functionality and improving performance:
1. **AI-Powered Vision**: Integrate computer vision for tasks like object detection and mapping, enabling the drone to autonomously identify and track litter.
2. **Obstacle Avoidance**: Develop and integrate obstacle detection algorithms to enhance flight safety in complex environments.
3. **Enhanced Payload Options**: Upgrade the drone to carry additional sensors and payloads, expanding its utility for various applications.

**Vision for the Future:** The ultimate goal is to create a modular and scalable drone platform that can be adapted for environmental monitoring, delivery services, and research applications.

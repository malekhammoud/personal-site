## INTRODUCTION

Robotics is the design, construction, operation, and application of robots. The field of computer science makes robots smart—from computer vision to if statements—and amazing technology comes together to do cool things.

## Societal Impacts
### Job Displacement & Creation
Robots have the power to destroy jobs and create new ones. This will have a massive impact on society as a massive amount of people will have to upskill to be able to make a living.

### Improved Quality of Life
Robots increase efficiency; the same number of people are able to do more. This increases the quality of life as there are more products/services to go around.

### Education & Skill Development
STEM fields like robotics are driving the push for integrating STEM in the classroom. An example of this is teaching programming in math classes.

### Robot Dependency
As robots become more common, humans will become more dependent on them. In the future, skills like washing dishes and cleaning floors will become nonexistent.

## Economic Impacts

### Increased Productivity & Efficiency
As mentioned above, robots will increase productivity. This increase in productivity means you can do more with your dollar. Companies will enjoy cost reduction, and consumers will enjoy a reduction in price.

### Industry Shifts
Entire industries will change. For example, self-driving vehicles might put taxi drivers out of business.

### Global Competitiveness
Countries that invest in robotics will enjoy the long-term economic advantages, while countries that don't will fall behind.

## Ethics
### Job Displacement and Economic Inequality
Is replacing humans with robots ethical? Some people think it's unethical and some people think it's not. People are replaced by robots and the ones to gain. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
### Bias in AI and Autonomous Systems
AI has bias; this bias gets translated into robots. The robots perform real-world actions which impact real people. An example of this is a self-driving car about to crash—will it crash into an old person or a young one? AI won't be able to think ethically and this results in potential unethical behavior in certain conditions.
### Privacy and Surveillance Concerns
Robots like drones have the potential to spy on people. As these drones get smaller and quieter, it becomes harder and harder to tell if someone is spying on you.
### Autonomous Weapons and Warfare
Robots and AI are the future of warfare. If you don't use technology you fall behind and lose the war. This results in a push to automate every aspect of warfare, including making decisions to kill people. Robots are going to kill people in war. They are already doing so.
### Moral and Legal Accountability
If an autonomous robot causes harm (e.g., a self-driving car crashes), who is ethically responsible? This question is very hard to answer and might result in the legal system punishing the wrong people.

## INTRODUCTION

The agricultural industry is essential for feeding the world, yet weed control remains a costly and time-consuming challenge. Weeds directly compete with crops for vital resources such as water, nutrients, and sunlight, significantly reducing yields and profitability for farmers. Traditionally, farmers have relied on herbicides for weed management; however, the overuse of these chemicals has led to serious environmental risks, including soil degradation, water contamination, and loss of biodiversity.

## Problem

Weed control is one of the most labor-intensive and expensive aspects of agriculture. Weeds not only compete with crops but also contribute to lower yields, ultimately affecting farmersâ€™ profitability. While herbicides offer a convenient solution, their excessive use presents significant drawbacks. In 2021, the world used over 1.7 million metric tons of herbicides, and these figures are growing every year (Statista 2023, Figure 1). Moreover, these chemicals pose considerable harm to the environment, contaminating soil and water, which endangers wildlife, beneficial insects, and human health. Herbicide runoff can seep into water sources, adversely impacting aquatic ecosystems and drinking water supplies. This situation is aggravated by climate change, with extreme weather patterns like heavy rains and droughts further spreading herbicide chemicals.

Small-scale farmers often bear the brunt of these challenges, lacking the financial means to invest in large-scale mechanical weed removal systems or the labor force to manage weeds manually. Although mechanical systems are available, they tend to be prohibitively expensive and inefficient for smaller operations. Consequently, there is a pressing demand for a scalable, cost-effective solution that can address these issues while reducing agriculture's environmental footprint.

## Purpose

The GreenGuardian project aims to tackle these challenges by developing an autonomous robot capable of detecting and eliminating weeds without excessive and widespread use of chemical herbicides. Designed to navigate agricultural fields autonomously, the robot employs machine learning algorithms to identify weeds and sprays them individually, therefore reducing the amount of herbicides used. This system has the potential to drastically reduce labor costs, improve crop yields, and minimize the environmental impact associated with traditional weed control methods.

By integrating advanced technologies such as computer vision, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI), GreenGuardian seeks to revolutionize weed management in agriculture. The long-term vision is to provide a solution that is accessible to both small-scale and large-scale farmers, promoting sustainable agricultural practices worldwide.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

### Hardware Prototype Development

The hardware development of GreenGuardian underwent several iterations to address various challenges associated with field navigation, weed detection, and mechanical weed removal. The primary goal was to design a robot that could traverse uneven terrain, withstand outdoor conditions, and accurately target weeds for removal.



### Prototype Iterations

The initial prototype was constructed using salvaged parts from a toy motor and a rudimentary steering mechanism. However, this design quickly proved inadequate due to the insufficient torque required to turn the robot effectively. The excessive weight of the structure exacerbated this issue, making it difficult for the robot to maneuver on rough terrains.

In the second iteration, a 3D-printed steering mechanism was incorporated to provide more precision and control. While this design showed improvements on flat surfaces, it still lacked the torque necessary for navigating agricultural fields. The robot could not handle the uneven and bumpy terrain found in most farming environments.

The final prototype (figure 2) addressed the limitations of previous iterations by incorporating two motors, one for each rear wheel. This design allowed the robot to turn more smoothly and efficiently, significantly improving its ability to navigate agricultural fields.

## RESULTS

The final GreenGuardian prototype successfully demonstrated its ability to navigate various terrains, including grass and uneven surfaces. With two motors powering the rear wheels, the robot exhibited stable motion and precise turns, even on inclines. The upgraded motor torque allowed the robot to smoothly maneuver and avoid stalling, while the larger wheels ensured stability over bumps and rough patches.

## CONCLUSION

GreenGuardian demonstrates the potential for automating weed control while reducing herbicide usage. The project has shown that this technology can be applied in backyards, golf courses, and agricultural fields, reducing costs and environmental impact. Continued research and testing will help optimize GreenGuardian for real-world applications, ultimately contributing to a healthier environment.

### üñ•Ô∏è Microsoft Challenge Complete
We wrapped up our Microsoft challenge this month! I built the working prototype below, and our team crafted a polished presentation deck to showcase our solution.

### üèÜ TVSEF Showcase
I attended the Thames Valley Science and Engineering Fair (TVSEF) and presented my project. Though I didn‚Äôt earn the trip to CWSF, my work was recognized with **two major awards**:

- **Gold Medal**
- **OES-Inc Excellence Award**
- **Entrance Scholarship** to the University of Ottawa

Below is a clip from my demonstration:

**Reflection:**
Not every outcome is in our control, and sometimes bias plays a role. While I was disappointed not to advance, the community feedback and these awards remind me that perseverance and quality work speak volumes. Life isn‚Äôt always fair, but we keep moving forward.

### ü§ù First Conference: Code Tracks Reacts!
I attended my first tech conference, **Code Tracks Reacts!**, where I practiced networking and learned from experts. Highlights included:

It was inspiring to connect with fellow developers and celebrate community innovation over snacks and great conversation.

### üåü Looking Ahead
March taught me the power of building, presenting, and persevering. As we move into May, I‚Äôm excited to:

1. Start the MoonShot at TKS
2. Come up with a project idea for next year's TVSEF
3. Build A Minecraft Mod in Java just for fun!


Thanks for following along this journey.

Best regards,

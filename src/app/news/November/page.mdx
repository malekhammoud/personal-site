## November Reflections: From Drones to Hackathons

This November has been packed with projects, growth, and new experiences. Here’s what I’ve been up to:

---

### 🚀 Joining TKS Velocity
I officially joined **TKS Velocity**, a program designed to help us reach our full potential through consistent reflection, goal-setting, and collaboration. The daily updates and insights from leaders like **Esther**, **Andres**, and **Patrick** have already had a huge impact on how I think about success and self-improvement.

### 🚁 Progress on My Litter-Picking Drone
One of the highlights this month was completing the autonomous programming for my **litter-picking drone**! It now flies programmatically using **Pydrone kit**, **Raspberry Pi**, and **Pixhawk**. Watching it take off and follow commands was such a proud moment. This project has been both challenging and rewarding, and I’m excited about its potential impact.

### 💭 Reflections from TKS Velocity
TKS Velocity has been pushing me to reflect on my actions and goals. Through our daily updates and sessions, I’ve realized how crucial mindset is for success. It’s not just about achieving goals but also understanding *why* those goals matter to me and aligning them with my values.

### 👜 Starting a Company with Junior Achievement
Our **Junior Achievement (JA)** company officially launched this month! We’re selling tote bags to our local community, and I was elected as **VP of Finance**. Leading a team in this capacity is a first for me, and I’m looking forward to growing through the experience. It’s exciting to build something from the ground up and manage the financial side of a business.

4. Have clear and good intentions behind your actions.

### 🎉 Hackathon Win: Posture Pal
João and I competed in the **Explore Hackathon**, and we created **Posture Pal** — a device that sprays you with water if you have bad posture. We used **MediaPipe** to track posture and a **Raspberry Pi Pico** to control the spray mechanism. It was such a fun project, and the best part is... we won! It was an incredible learning experience and a great example of teamwork and creativity.

### 🌟 Looking Ahead
November has been a month of growth, from programming drones to starting new ventures and reflecting on life. As we head into December, I’m excited to keep this momentum going and tackle even bigger challenges.

Thanks for reading,

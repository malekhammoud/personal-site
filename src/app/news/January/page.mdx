## 🧠 Mindsets & Growth

### 1. Bias Toward Action
I prioritized **doing** over *overthinking* this month:
- Ramped up cold emailing to connect with mentors/industry peers
- Landed unexpected opportunities through sheer momentum
💡 **Takeaway:** Progress compounds when you start before feeling ready.

### 2. Stoicism in Practice
Tested mental toughness through deliberate discomfort:
- Slept on floor (painful but made mornings 10x easier!)
- Cold showers daily
💡 **Reflective Thought:** "Comfort is the enemy of growth."

### 3. Antifragility
Transformed setbacks into fuel:
- Exam results fell short → practiced stoic detachment → channeled energy into systems
- **Antifragility Win:** The more challenges I face, the more I adapt instead of break.

## ⚙️ Habits & Systems
- **Time Management:** Using Trello for time-blocking (deep work/cold outreach/fitness)
- **Habit:** I got into the habit of Journalising right before bed, this helps a lot with my sleep.

## 🚀 Looking Ahead
- **Cold Outreach:** 2x meaningful connections/month
- **Habit Mastery:** Experiment with Pomodoro + Trello hybrids
- **Robotics:**  Starting to test outdoors, as soon as it becomes warm enough(>0°C)

*2025 is about building systems that outlast motivation.*

Thank you for being part of the journey. Onward!

**Best regards,**

## February Newsletter: Action, Resilience, and Growth

As we move into a new phase of the year, February has been a month of reflection, consistent effort, and actionable insights. Below, I share brief reflections on the mindsets that guided me during Weeks 13 and 14, along with a quick update on news.

### Compounding

Inspired by Charlie Munger‚Äôs philosophy, this week reminded me not to confuse thinking with achieving results. I set high standards‚Äîaiming for üåÆ over üçû‚Äîand committed to growing 1% every day. Whether it was hitting the gym or sharpening my focus, consistency was key. I reinforced my habits by tuning into podcasts, diving into MIT Tech Review, and even picking up a new language on Duolingo. Surround yourself with like-minded people, or create that environment through podcasts and Slack if needed.

### Perspective

Anne Wojcicki‚Äôs insights pushed me to consider how we all live in our own "fishbowls." This week, I worked on broadening my perspective by actively questioning assumptions. Instead of assuming what others might need or think, I made an effort to learn from diverse viewpoints‚Äîfrom family and friends to random conversations on the bus. It‚Äôs a reminder that true understanding comes from asking questions and gathering real data about other people's experiences.

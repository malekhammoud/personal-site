## December Newsletter: Reflections and Achievements

With 2024 coming to an end, December received tremendous progress, collaboration, and self-improvement. Here's a summary of what I worked on, learned from, and reflected upon in December:

---

### ‚ú® Projects & Achievements

#### 1. IKEA Challenge
I joined an **IKEA challenge** with my team this month. We analyzed the limitations of IKEA‚Äôs current recommendation system and proposed innovative features to enhance user experience:
- The existing system relies on **Recommendations AI** by Google Cloud, **knowledge graphs**, and **manual tagging**.
- Our proposed solution incorporates a **CNN** to filter recommendations based on stylistic similarity of item images, making the system more hip and personalized.
üí° **Key Takeaway:** A deep understanding of underlying systems can lead to state-of-the-art improvements.

#### 2. Focus Project Progress
I made significant progress on my robotics project, designing a **gripper/walking robot**. The robot uses an innovative walking method, avoiding the conventional step-sway-step pattern:
- The design incorporates **two joints per leg**, reducing complexity and enabling efficient movement.
üé• **Videos demo coming soon!**

### ???? Mindsets & Reflections

#### Figure-It-Out Mindset
I embraced the **figure-it-out mindset**, approaching challenges creatively and effectively.

#### Power of Teamwork
The IKEA challenge highlighted the importance of teamwork:
- **Communication**, **psychological safety**, and **team vibes** were key to success.
- Inspired by insights from *Smarter, Faster, Better*, I learned that open and respectful communication fosters extraordinary results.
üí° **Reflective Thought:** Always prioritize good team dynamics over individual brilliance, as collaboration drives success.

#### Emotional Awareness & Motivation
Balancing emotions with commitment was crucial this month:
- I focused on making my goals bigger than my feelings, improving consistency and productivity.
- The IKEA challenge emphasized the importance of **team dynamics** and setting **high-focused intentions**.

### Looking Ahead üöÄ

As this year comes to an end, I look forward with excitement to further innovations in robotics and AI-driven solutions. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs next:
- Build on the **teamwork lessons** of this month for stronger collaboration in the future.
- Continue refining my ability to balance **emotions**, **productivity**, and **long-term vision**.

Thank you for following my journey. Here‚Äôs to an even more productive and impactful 2025!

### üíº PCB Business Card Project
This month, I took networking to the next level by designing and creating my own PCB (Printed Circuit Board) business card! This combines my passion for electronics with a unique way to share my professional identity.

The project involved designing the circuit, laying out the components, and bringing it all together into a functional, professional-looking card. You can check out the full project and source files on my GitHub repository: [PCB-Business-Card](https://github.com/malekhammoud/PCB-Business-Card).

This was a fantastic way to showcase my technical skills while creating something practical that stands out when networking!

### üè´ School Club Leadership
May marked the conclusion of activities for three school clubs I've been deeply involved with this year: STEM Club, Math Club, and Programming Club. It's been an incredible journey of learning, collaboration, and growth.

I'm honored to announce that I've been selected as the president of all three clubs for the upcoming school year! This leadership opportunity means a lot to me, and I'm already brainstorming exciting projects and activities to engage our members next year.

As president, my goals include:
- Expanding project-based learning opportunities in the STEM Club
- Organizing math competitions and collaborative problem-solving events
- Developing coding workshops and hackathons for Programming Club members

I believe these clubs provide crucial opportunities for students to explore their interests outside the classroom, and I'm committed to creating an inclusive and inspiring environment for everyone involved.
